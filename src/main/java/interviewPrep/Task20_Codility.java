    //20
Write a function:
that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N,
 each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be
 replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a number is
 divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by
  a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this
   given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be
    replacée by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3
     and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
